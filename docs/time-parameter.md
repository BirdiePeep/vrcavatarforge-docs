Adding this option modifies how the action's animation gets played.  Typically an animation would play over seconds of time.  Instead the animation's time is controlled by the specified parameter.  

- **Parameter:** The parameter you want to control the time of the action's animation.  A value of 0.0 puts the animation at the first keyframe, a value of 1.0 puts the animation at the last keyframe.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently this option only works with animations supplied by [Play Animation](play-animation.md)
