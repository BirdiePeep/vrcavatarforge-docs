![non-menu-actions](~/images/non-menu-actions.png)

Used to add behaviours to your avatar that aren't tied to an action menu control.
For Example: Playing animation that triggers on AFK, or playing an idle animation.

- **Fade In:** Time in seconds for the control to fade in.
- **Fade Out:** Time in seconds for the control to fade out.
- **Hold:** Time in seconds the control will stay ON before fading out.  For example, you may want an animation to play for minimum of X seconds even if the user has turned the control OFF.
