# How To Use

The first step is to attach the Avatar Forge component to either your avatar or asset you want affected.  You can do this by using the 'Add Component' button in your inspector for that object.

Once the script is added you will need to add a Feature, these are the core building blocks of Avatar Forge.  Each Feature performs it's own function.  [Learn More About Features](features.md).
